# Chi-Square Correlation of Heart Rate and Blood Pressure

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on analyzing the correlation between heart rate and blood pressure using the Chi-Square test. The project aims to explore the statistical relationship between these vital signs and provide insights into their interdependence.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- `data/`: Contains datasets used for analysis.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, analysis, and model implementation.
- `results/`: Store output files, visualizations, and result summaries.

## Requirements
To run the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for visualization)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/Chi-Square-Correlation-of-Heart-Rate-and-Blood-Pressure.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd Chi-Square-Correlation-of-Heart-Rate-and-Blood-Pressure
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook for data analysis:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess data, perform Chi-Square test, and visualize results.
Results
The project provides statistical insights into the correlation between heart rate and blood pressure using Chi-Square analysis. Results are presented visually and can be further interpreted to understand the relationship between these vital signs.

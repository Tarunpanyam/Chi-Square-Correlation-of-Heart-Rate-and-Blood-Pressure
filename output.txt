Observed Frequencies of Heart rate & BP are as follows: 
[8 65 32]
[2 53 50]
The observed value of Heart rate in between 0-59  : 8
The observed value of Heart rate in between 60-80: 65
The observed value of Heart rate in above   80     : 32
The observed value of BP in between 0-59           : 2
The observed value of BP in between 60-80         : 53
The observed value of BP in above 80                 : 50
Value of Chi-square: 8.77155849524597
 At Confidence Level 95.0%
The critical value is 5.991464547107979
----------------------------------------------------
Confidence=0.950, critical=5.991, stat=8.772
Correlation based on probability is as follows: 
Since Statistical value is greater than Cirtical value : HR and BP are Dependent on each other (reject H0) 
 significance=0.050, p=0.012453 
Correlation based on significance is as follows: 
Since P value is less than significance value : HR and BP are Dependent on each other (reject H0) 
---------------Correlation strength---------------- 
 The Cofficient of Correlation is 0.24 , HR and BP have Weakly Correlation
